# Horiseon-Challenge

## Description

My motivation for this project was to optimize this website to meet accessibility standards and for it to work on all search engines. I built this project because it updated the website to make it is accessible to all types of users, soliving issues such as font size, font style, changing colors to make the homepage look cohesive, and fixing the heading links. I learned how to read the code and make sure it is in sequential order, and it helped me think about how to make my webpages more accessible.
